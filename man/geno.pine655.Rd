geno.pine655
}
\description{
Genotypic data for a total of 4,853 SNPs (coded as 0, 1, 2 and -9 for missing)
on 655 genotypes of Loblolly Pine (\emph{Pinus taeda} L.).
Dataset modified from supplementary material from Resende \emph{et al.} (2012).
This dataset differs from the original as some genotypes were made artificially
missing by full-sib family.
